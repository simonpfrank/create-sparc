# Product Requirements Document: create-sparc-py

## Product Overview

### Product Name
create-sparc-py

### Product Description
create-sparc-py is a Python port of the create-sparc Node.js tool, designed to scaffold new Python projects following the SPARC methodology structure. It provides an easy-to-use command-line interface to generate project templates, configure components, and implement both the SPARC approach and aiGI functionality in Python projects within the Roo Code environment, specifically for use with Roo's boomerang mode.

This project is based on the original work by Reuven Cohen ([@ruvnet](https://github.com/ruvnet)) in the [rUv-dev](https://github.com/ruvnet/rUv-dev) repository.

### Target Users
- Python developers using Roo Code
- Teams implementing SPARC methodology in Python projects
- Developers looking to quickly bootstrap Python projects with a consistent structure
- Users migrating from the Node.js version of create-sparc to Python

## Product Goals

### Primary Goals
1. Provide a complete Python port of the create-sparc tool that maintains all existing functionality
2. Support scaffolding Python projects that follow the SPARC methodology
3. Integrate with Roo Code's boomerang mode
4. Support aiGI approach where applicable
5. Maintain the same user experience and command structure as the original tool
6. Support Python 3.12+

### Secondary Goals
1. Improve documentation with comprehensive Sphinx-based docs using Google-style docstrings
2. Follow Python best practices and conventions
3. Provide a smooth transition path for users of the Node.js version

## Features and Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. **Project Initialization**
   - Initialize new Python projects with SPARC structure
   - Support various project templates (minimal, standard, aiGI)
   - Generate appropriate directory structures and boilerplate code

2. **Command-Line Interface**
   - Support all commands from the original tool:
     - `init`: Create a new SPARC project
     - `add`: Add components to an existing project
     - `help`: Display help information 
     - `wizard`: Interactive project setup wizard
     - `configure-mcp`: Configure MCP components
     - `aigi`: Create a new AIGI project
     - `minimal`: Create a new minimal Roo mode framework

3. **Template Management**
   - Convert JavaScript/TypeScript templates to Python
   - Maintain other template files as-is
   - Support template customization and extension

4. **Configuration Management**
   - Manage project configuration files
   - Support loading and saving configuration

5. **File Management**
   - Create, modify, and manage project files
   - Handle file permissions and symlinks

6. **Registry Client**
   - Communicate with remote registries (if applicable)
   - Handle authentication and authorization

7. **MCP Wizard**
   - Configure MCP components interactively
   - Generate MCP configuration files

### Technical Requirements

1. **Python Compatibility**
   - Target Python 3.12+
   - Use modern Python features where appropriate

2. **Package Management**
   - Use Poetry for dependency management
   - Create a well-structured pyproject.toml

3. **Command-Line Interface**
   - Use argparse for command-line argument parsing
   - Support both short and long parameter names
   - Parse arguments into a dictionary called script_args

4. **Project Structure**
   - Use package-name as the root
   - Main source code in package_name directory
   - Follow standard Python project structure

5. **Testing**
   - Implement comprehensive tests using pytest
   - Maintain high test coverage
   - Support both unit and integration tests

6. **Documentation**
   - Use Sphinx for documentation generation
   - Follow Google format for docstrings
   - Include docstrings for all Python files
   - Provide comprehensive user and developer documentation

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - Fast project generation and configuration
   - Efficient file operations

2. **Usability**
   - Intuitive command-line interface
   - Clear error messages and feedback
   - Comprehensive documentation

3. **Maintainability**
   - Well-structured and documented code
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Consistent coding style

4. **Reliability**
   - Robust error handling
   - Graceful degradation on network issues
   - Comprehensive test suite

## Dependencies
The following Python packages will be required:

- argparse - Command-line argument parsing
- colorama - Terminal color output (equivalent to chalk)
- jinja2 - Template rendering
- pyyaml - YAML file handling
- pytest - Testing framework
- pytest-cov - Test coverage
- sphinx - Documentation generation
- sphinx-rtd-theme - Documentation theme
- poetry - Package management

## Deliverables

1. **Source Code**
   - Complete Python port of create-sparc
   - Converted templates
   - Test suite

2. **Documentation**
   - User guide
   - Developer documentation
   - API reference

3. **Configuration Files**
   - pyproject.toml for Poetry
   - Configuration templates

4. **Tests**
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - Test fixtures

## Success Criteria

1. All features from the original create-sparc tool are successfully ported
2. Generated Python projects follow SPARC methodology correctly
3. Tool successfully integrates with Roo Code's boomerang mode
4. All tests pass with high coverage
5. Documentation is comprehensive and accurate
6. Tool is easy to install and use

## Constraints and Limitations

1. Target Python 3.12+ only
2. Focus on maintaining feature parity with the original tool rather than adding new features
3. Maintain backward compatibility with existing templates where possible

## Timeline and Milestones

This will be tracked in the tracker.md file with the following progression:

1. Initial setup and project structure
2. Core utilities and helpers
3. File and configuration management
4. Command-line interface
5. Project generation
6. Template conversion
7. Registry client
8. MCP wizard
9. Testing and documentation
10. Final integration and validation
