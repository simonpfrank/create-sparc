The MCP Wizard makes setup simple:

- **Interactive configuration** guides you through connecting services
- **Automatic discovery** of available MCP servers
- **Validation and verification** of all configurations
- **Clear documentation** for each integration step
- **Seamless updates** when service requirements change

## Usage

### Create a new project

You can create a new project in two ways:

```bash
# Create a full project with a specific name
npx create-sparc init my-project

# Create only .roo and .roomodes files in the current directory
npx create-sparc init
```

You can also use the shorthand version:

```bash
npx create-sparc my-project
```

### Create an AI-driven Code Generation (AIGI) project

If you want to create a project focused on AI-driven code generation with specialized components:

```bash
# Create a new AIGI project with a specific name
npx create-sparc aigi init my-project

# Initialize AIGI files in the current directory
npx create-sparc aigi init
```

The AIGI project provides specialized components for prompt engineering, code quality assessment, and iterative refinement of AI-generated code.

### Create a minimal Roo mode framework

If you want to create a lightweight framework for custom Roo modes without the full SPARC structure:

```bash
# Create a new minimal Roo mode framework with a specific name
npx create-sparc minimal init my-project

# Initialize minimal Roo mode files in the current directory
npx create-sparc minimal init
```

The minimal Roo mode framework provides just the essential files and structure needed to get started with Roo mode development, making it ideal for developers who want to create their own custom modes.

### Running with Node directly

If you're running the CLI directly with Node (instead of using npx), use the following format:

```bash
# When running with Node directly
node bin/index.js init my-project
node bin/index.js aigi init my-project
node bin/index.js minimal init my-project

# IMPORTANT: Do not include 'create-sparc' in the command when running with Node
# Incorrect: node bin/index.js create-sparc init
# Correct:   node bin/index.js init
```

The `create-sparc` prefix is only used when running through npx, as it's the package name.

Options for init command:
- `--template <name>` - Template to use (default: "default")
- `--skip-install` - Skip dependency installation
- `--use-npm` - Use npm as package manager
- `--use-yarn` - Use yarn as package manager

- `--no-git` - Skip git initialization
- `--typescript` - Use TypeScript
- `--no-symlink` - Disable symlink creation

Options for minimal command:
- `-f, --force` - Allow initialization in non-empty directories
- `--skip-install` - Skip dependency installation
- `--use-npm` - Use npm as package manager
- `--use-yarn` - Use yarn as package manager
- `--use-pnpm` - Use pnpm as package manager
- `--no-git` - Skip git initialization
- `--typescript` - Use TypeScript
- `--no-symlink` - Disable symlink creation

### Initialize SPARC files in an existing project

If you want to add SPARC methodology to an existing project, you can run:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd my-existing-project

# Initialize SPARC files (.roo and .roomodes) without creating project structure
npx create-sparc init

# Or if running with Node directly
node path/to/bin/index.js init
```

This will only create the necessary SPARC files in your current directory without modifying your existing project structure.

### Add a component to an existing project

```bash
npx create-sparc add component --name MyComponent
```

Options:
- `--name <name>` - Component name
- `--type <type>` - Component type (default: "component")
- `--path <path>` - Custom path for component

### Get help

```bash

## MCP Wizard

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) Wizard is a powerful feature that simplifies the configuration and management of external service integrations in your SPARC projects.

### What is the MCP Wizard?

The MCP Wizard is a configuration system that enables seamless integration between your SPARC projects and external services like databases, AI models, cloud providers, and more. It provides:

- **Simplified Service Configuration**: Easily connect to external services with guided setup
- **Secure Credential Management**: Store API keys and tokens as environment variable references
- **Permission Scoping**: Configure appropriate access levels for each service
- **AI Assistant Integration**: Enable Roo Code to interact with external services

The MCP Configuration Wizard consists of the following components:

1. **MCP Wizard** - Main entry point that orchestrates the configuration process
2. **Configuration Generator** - Creates MCP.json configurations and roomode definitions
3. **Registry Client** - Interacts with the MCP Registry API to discover available servers
4. **Security Module** - Ensures proper handling of sensitive information
5. **File Manager** - Provides safe and reliable file system operations for configurations

### MCP Configuration Files

The MCP Wizard manages two main configuration files:

1. **MCP Configuration File** (`.roo/mcp.json`): Contains server configurations, including command, arguments, and permission scopes.

2. **Roomodes File** (`.roomodes`): Contains roomode definitions for MCP servers, enabling AI assistants to interact with the servers.

Example MCP configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "supabase": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@supabase/mcp-server-supabase@latest",
        "--access-token",
        "${env:SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN}"
      ],
      "alwaysAllow": [
        "list_tables",
        "execute_sql"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The MCP.json file follows this schema:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "[server-id]": {
      "command": "string",
      "args": ["string"],
      "alwaysAllow": ["string"],
      "env": {
        "ENV_VAR": "value"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

MCP integration roomodes follow this structure:

```json
{
  "slug": "mcp-[server-id]",
  "name": "Server Name Integration",
  "model": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
  "roleDefinition": "You are a specialized assistant...",

- Example configurations
- Roomode templates

For testing purposes, a mock implementation of the Registry Client is available, which simulates all Registry API endpoints without requiring an actual registry server.

### MCP Integration Best Practices

1. **Version Control**: Add `.roo/mcp.json` to version control but exclude any files containing actual secrets.

2. **Environment Variables**: Use a `.env` file for local development (added to `.gitignore`) and proper environment variable management for production.

3. **Regular Updates**: Periodically check for updates to MCP servers and update your configurations.

4. **Permission Auditing**: Regularly review the permissions granted to each server and remove any that are no longer needed.

5. **Documentation**: Document the MCP servers used in your project and their configuration requirements for team members.

6. **Secure Storage of Environment Variables**:
   - For development: Use `.env` files (but don't commit them to version control)
   - For production: Use a secrets management solution (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, etc.)

7. **Follow the principle of least privilege**: Grant only the permissions that are necessary

8. **Use specific package versions**: Avoid using "latest" to prevent supply chain attacks
