# ðŸ“‹ Project Brief

## Project Overview
This project implements a modular approach to organizing rules and guidelines for Cline to follow when working with projects, incorporating the SPARC methodology for structured development. It replaces the single `.clinerules` file with a directory structure that allows for contextual activation of specific rules, easier maintenance, team flexibility, and reduced noise while providing a structured workflow for development tasks.

## Core Requirements
- Create a modular folder structure for organizing Cline rules
- Support contextual activation of specific rules
- Provide a memory bank system for persistent memory between sessions
- Enable easier maintenance of rules
- Allow team flexibility with rule activation
- Reduce noise by keeping the active ruleset focused
- Integrate SPARC methodology (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion)
- Support modular development with clear file and function size limits
- Ensure security through proper environment variable handling

## Project Scope
- Creation of the `.clinerules/` directory structure
- Implementation of core rule files
- Creation of memory bank files
- Development of a rule management script
- Creation of a rule bank with categorized rule sets

## Key Stakeholders
- Development team members who will use the rules
- Project managers who need to ensure consistent guidelines
- Cline users who will benefit from the improved context

## Success Criteria
- Rules can be selectively activated and deactivated
- Memory bank provides persistent context between sessions
- Rule structure is clear and well-organized
- System is easy to maintain and extend

## Timeline
- Initial implementation: Complete
- Rule bank expansion: Ongoing
- Integration with Cline UI: Pending

## Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing Cline functionality
- Should not require significant changes to user workflows

## Assumptions
- Users are familiar with basic Cline operations
- The system will be used primarily by development teams

## Risks
- Complexity of rule management might discourage adoption
- Emoji file naming might cause issues in some file systems

## Dependencies
- Cline's ability to process rules from a directory structure
- File system support for the directory structure

## Notes
The clinerules-bank directory contains additional rule sets that can be activated as needed, and the manage-rules.sh script provides a command-line interface for managing rule activation.
