# ðŸ”„ Active Context

## Current Focus
The current focus is on integrating the SPARC methodology into the `.clinerules/` folder structure. This includes updating core rule files, enhancing the memory bank system, and ensuring the system supports structured development workflows through the SPARC (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion) approach.

## Recent Changes
- Integrated SPARC methodology principles into core rule files
- Enhanced coding standards with SPARC-based modular development guidelines
- Updated system patterns documentation to reflect SPARC workflow
- Created visual workflow diagrams for SPARC methodology integration
- Maintained the existing directory structure while enhancing content

## Current Challenges
- Ensuring emoji file names work correctly across different file systems
- Making sure the rule management script is user-friendly and intuitive
- Balancing comprehensiveness with simplicity in the rule files
- Ensuring the memory bank system provides sufficient context without overwhelming users

## Active Decisions
- Using emoji prefixes for memory bank files to make them visually distinct
- Organizing rules into logical categories (general, code-specific, testing)
- Using a bash script for rule management rather than a more complex solution
- Keeping core rule files separate from context-specific rules in the bank

## Key Patterns & Preferences

### Code Patterns
- Markdown formatting for all rule files
- Consistent section headings across similar rule files
- Bullet points for individual rules within sections
- Descriptive file names that reflect content

### Architectural Decisions
- Directory-based approach rather than a single file
- Separation of core rules from context-specific rules
- Memory bank system for persistent context
- Command-line tool for rule management

### Team Preferences
- Preference for clarity and simplicity in rule descriptions
- Focus on practical, actionable guidelines rather than abstract principles
- Emphasis on flexibility and contextual activation

## Learnings & Insights
- The directory structure approach provides much more flexibility than a single file
- Emoji prefixes make memory bank files more visually distinct and memorable
- Separating rules by context allows for more focused guidance
- The management script makes it easier to activate and deactivate rules as needed

## Next Steps
1. Test the rule management script with different rule combinations
2. Expand the rule bank with additional context-specific rule sets
3. Develop integration with the Cline UI for visual rule management
4. Create rule templates for common project types
5. Implement rule versioning and change tracking

## Open Questions
- How can we best handle rule conflicts when multiple rule files are activated?
- What's the optimal balance between comprehensive rules and keeping things simple?
- How can we measure the effectiveness of the new approach compared to the old one?

## Notes
The current implementation focuses on the core functionality. Future enhancements will include more sophisticated rule management, integration with the Cline UI, and additional rule templates for common project types.
