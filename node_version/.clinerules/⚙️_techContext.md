# ⚙️ Technical Context

## SPARC Development Methodology

The project follows the SPARC methodology for structured development:

1. **Specification**: Define requirements, constraints, and acceptance criteria
2. **Pseudocode**: Develop high-level logic with TDD anchors
3. **Architecture**: Design modular components with clear interfaces
4. **Refinement**: Implement with TDD, debugging, and optimization
5. **Completion**: Integrate, document, test, and verify against criteria

### Technical Requirements
- Files must not exceed 500 lines
- Functions must follow single responsibility principle
- No hardcoded environment variables or secrets
- All code must include proper error handling
- Modular architecture with clear component boundaries
- Comprehensive test coverage for critical functionality

## Testing Strategy

### SPARC Testing Approach
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) for all new features
- Tests written during Pseudocode phase before implementation
- Comprehensive test coverage for critical functionality
- Automated testing integrated into CI/CD pipeline

### Unit Testing
- Test individual components in isolation
- Mock dependencies for pure unit testing
- Aim for >80% code coverage on critical paths
- Focus on edge cases and error handling

### Integration Testing
- Test component interactions and interfaces
- Verify correct data flow between modules
- Test API contracts and boundaries
- Ensure proper error propagation

### End-to-End Testing
- [Framework and approach]
- [Critical user flows to test]
