# ðŸ“š Documentation Requirements

## SPARC Documentation Principles

- **Specification**: Document requirements, constraints, and acceptance criteria
- **Pseudocode**: Document high-level logic and core functions before implementation
- **Architecture**: Document component relationships, interfaces, and boundaries
- **Refinement**: Document optimization decisions and refactoring rationale
- **Completion**: Verify documentation against implementation and acceptance criteria

## Code Documentation

- Document public APIs with clear descriptions of parameters, return values, and exceptions
- Include examples where appropriate
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
- Document complex algorithms or business logic
- Add TODO comments for incomplete features or known issues
- Auto-document every feature with clear purpose and usage examples
- Document environment variable requirements without hardcoding values

## Project Documentation

- Maintain a clear README with project overview, setup instructions, and usage examples
- Document architecture decisions and system design
- Keep a changelog of significant changes
- Document environment requirements and dependencies
- Include troubleshooting guides for common issues
- Document modular structure and component relationships
- Include diagrams for complex workflows and architectures

## Comments

- Use comments to explain "why" rather than "what" when the code isn't self-explanatory
- Keep comments concise and relevant
- Update comments when the corresponding code changes
- Use standardized comment formats for documentation generation tools if applicable
- Document security considerations and validation requirements
