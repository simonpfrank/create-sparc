### Integration Testing Strategy

1. **Component Pair Testing**
   - Test pairs of tightly coupled components
   - Verify interfaces and data flow
   - Validate error propagation

2. **Subsystem Integration**
   - Test complete subsystems (CLI, generator, etc.)
   - Validate subsystem boundaries
   - Verify subsystem contracts

3. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Test full command flows
   - Verify project creation process
   - Validate error handling and recovery

4. **Cross-Platform Testing**
   - Test on Windows, macOS, and Linux
   - Verify platform-specific behavior
   - Validate symlink handling across platforms

5. **Version Compatibility Testing**
   - Test with multiple Node.js versions
   - Verify npm/yarn/pnpm compatibility
   - Test extension compatibility

### Integration Verification Checklist

- [ ] All components can be initialized with proper dependencies
- [ ] Components communicate through defined interfaces only
- [ ] Error handling works across component boundaries
- [ ] Configuration flows properly through the system
- [ ] System performs as expected under different operating conditions
- [ ] Cross-cutting concerns are properly handled
