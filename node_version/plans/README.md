# Create-SPARC NPX Package: Architecture Blueprint

## Overview

This directory contains the complete architectural blueprint for the create-sparc NPX package. The package is designed to scaffold new projects following the SPARC (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion) methodology, with a focus on symlink capabilities for .roo folder and .roomode files to prevent duplication.

## Key Features

- Command-line interface for creating and managing SPARC projects
- Symlink management for .roo folder and .roomode files
- Template-based project generation
- Robust error handling with recovery mechanisms
- Extensible architecture supporting plugins and custom templates
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Document Structure

### Core Architecture

1. [**System Component Diagram**](system-component-diagram.md) - High-level view of system components and their relationships
2. [**File Structure**](file-structure.md) - Detailed file organization with component descriptions
3. [**Data Flow**](data-flow.md) - Sequence diagrams and descriptions of the installation process
4. [**Error Handling**](error-handling.md) - Comprehensive error handling architecture
5. [**Extension Points**](extension-points.md) - Future extensibility mechanisms

### SPARC Methodology Phases

1. [**Specification**](phases/1-specification.md) - Project objectives, requirements, constraints, and acceptance criteria
2. [**Pseudocode**](phases/2-pseudocode.md) - High-level logic, core functions, and data structures
3. [**Architecture**](phases/3-architecture.md) - Detailed component design, interfaces, and implementation considerations
4. [**Refinement**](phases/4-refinement.md) - Testing, debugging, security, and optimization strategies
5. [**Completion**](phases/5-completion.md) - Integration, documentation, deployment, monitoring, and improvement plans

## Implementation Guide

To implement the create-sparc NPX package based on this architecture:

1. Start with the [**Specification**](phases/1-specification.md) to understand the requirements
2. Review the [**System Component Diagram**](system-component-diagram.md) for a high-level overview
3. Follow the [**File Structure**](file-structure.md) to set up the project organization
4. Use the [**Pseudocode**](phases/2-pseudocode.md) to guide initial implementation
5. Implement components according to the [**Architecture**](phases/3-architecture.md) document
6. Apply the strategies from the [**Refinement**](phases/4-refinement.md) document
7. Complete the project using the [**Completion**](phases/5-completion.md) checklist

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Modular Component Architecture** - Clear separation of concerns with well-defined interfaces
2. **Symlink Management** - Specialized component for handling symlinks with fallback mechanisms
3. **Template-Based Generation** - Flexible template system for project scaffolding
4. **Comprehensive Error Handling** - Categorized errors with recovery strategies
5. **Progressive Enhancement** - Core functionality works across platforms with enhanced features where supported

## Architectural Constraints

1. **No Hard-Coded Secrets** - Security-focused design with no embedded credentials
2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility** - Must work on Windows, macOS, and Linux
3. **Node.js Environment** - Designed for the Node.js ecosystem
4. **NPM Package Standards** - Follows standard practices for NPM packages
5. **Symlink Limitations** - Handles platform-specific symlink restrictions

## Extension Mechanisms

The architecture includes several extension points for future enhancements:

1. **Plugin System** - For adding new functionality
2. **Custom Templates** - For specialized project types
3. **Command Extensions** - For additional CLI commands
4. **Hook System** - For customizing the generation process
5. **Configuration Extensions** - For additional configuration options

## Next Steps

After reviewing the architecture documentation:

1. Set up the development environment
2. Create the initial project structure
3. Implement core components (File Manager, Symlink Manager)
4. Develop the CLI interface
5. Implement the template system
6. Add project generation logic
7. Implement error handling
8. Add tests and documentation
9. Prepare for release
